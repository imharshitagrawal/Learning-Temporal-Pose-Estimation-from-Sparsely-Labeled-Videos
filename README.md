### Learning-Temporal-Pose-Estimation-from-Sparsely-Labeled-Videos
This project is an implementation of the 2019 research paper "Learning Temporal Pose Estimation from Sparsely Labeled Videos(NeurIPS 2019)"

# Introduction
This is a tensorflow implementation of *Learning Temporal Pose Estimation from Sparsely Labeled Videos*. In this work, we introduce a framework that reduces the need for densely labeled video data, while producing pose detection performance. Our approach is useful even when training videos are densely labeled.
